# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out olivercareyncl.co.uk

Note: The data used in the projects (accessed under the data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
- Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
- Run notebooks as usual by using a Jupyter Notebook server, VSCode, etc.

## Contents

### Machine Learning
- **House Prices - Advanced Regression Analysis**: A Kaggle competition project predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. Techniques include feature engineering, handling missing data, and applying various machine learning algorithms to optimize model performance.
  *Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib*

- **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**: Classic Kaggle challenge that uses various classification algorithms to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. Emphasis on feature engineering and model selection.
  *Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn*

### Natural Language Processing
- **Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets**: Developed a classifier to identify whether tweets about disasters are real or not. Involves data cleaning, feature extraction, and applying machine learning models.
  *Tools: NLTK, Scikit-learn, XGBoost*

### Time Series Forecasting
- **Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting**: Forecasting store sales using historical sales data to predict future sales trends. Techniques include time series decomposition, seasonal adjustments, and ARIMA modeling.
  *Tools: Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib*

### Creative Projects
- **Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself**: A creative project focused on image classification using a custom dataset of famous paintings. Includes data preprocessing, CNN training, and model evaluation.
  *Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib*
