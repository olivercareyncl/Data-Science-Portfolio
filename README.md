# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing a portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out olivercareyncl.co.uk

Note: The data used in the projects (accessed under the data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
- Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
- Run notebooks as usual by using a Jupyter Notebook server, VSCode, etc.

## Contents

### Machine Learning
- **House Prices - Advanced Regression Analysis**: A Kaggle competition project predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. Techniques include feature engineering, handling missing data, and applying various machine learning algorithms to optimize model performance.
  *Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib*

- **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**: Classic Kaggle challenge that uses various classification algorithms to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. Emphasis on feature engineering and model selection.
  *Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn*
